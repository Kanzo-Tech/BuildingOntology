abstract=The construction sector faces critical challenges in efficiency, sustainability, and resource management, being one of the sectors with the greatest environmental impact. To address this, the ECiCo project aims to drive the sector's transition towards a Circular Economy (CE) model through a technological solution that integrates efficient data sharing and promotes construction sustainability. The ECiCo ontology network will formalize, structure, integrate, and model knowledge in construction, establishing a common semantic language to tackle interoperability, improve decision-making regarding sustainability, resource efficiency, waste reduction, and project lifecycle optimization. This network will also serve as a lingua franca, enabling stakeholders in a data space to share reusable resources. The ontology's domain is the construction sector with a focus on Circular Economy, encompassing resource management, sustainability, material traceability, carbon footprint, data interoperability, Digital Twins, BIM models, and waste management. OWL has been chosen as the implementation language due to its W3C recommendation and widespread acceptance in the linked data web community.

description=The ECiCo ontology network is designed with the primary objective of comprehensively formalizing, structuring, integrating, and modeling knowledge inherent to the construction domain, with a particular focus on Circular Economy principles. Its development addresses the urgent need to establish a unified semantic language, essential for overcoming interoperability challenges and improving decision-making in crucial aspects such as sustainability, resource efficiency, waste minimization, and comprehensive project lifecycle optimization. This network will act as a conceptual lingua franca, enabling the various stakeholders involved in the construction data ecosystem to effectively share and reuse resources, covering key areas like resource management, material traceability, carbon footprint, data interoperability, Digital Twins, BIM models, and waste management. It will be implemented in OWL, a recognized W3C standard.
introduction=The construction sector stands at a critical juncture, confronting significant challenges in efficiency, sustainability, and resource management, positioning it as one of the primary contributors to environmental impact. In this pressing context, the ECiCo initiative emerges with the fundamental purpose of catalyzing the sector's transformation towards a Circular Economy model. This will be achieved through the development of an advanced technological solution that will not only facilitate efficient data sharing but also actively promote more sustainable practices across the entire construction value chain, laying the groundwork for a more resilient and responsible industry.
